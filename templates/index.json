We do it because we think that gloves are important and because a good pair of gloves is a thing of joy. You may be surprised to learn that there are 2.5 meters (that’s 8 foot) of stitching in a pair of gloves and at Cornelia James we have spent over 70 years trying to make each stitch perfect. And we've got a Royal Warrant - glovemakers by appointment to Her Majesty the Queen.<\/p>",
